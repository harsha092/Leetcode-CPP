You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps


class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
          if (n == 0 || n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        return climbStairs(n-1) + climbStairs(n-2);
    }
};
